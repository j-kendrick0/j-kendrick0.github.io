<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a technical writer with an academic background in English and a natural aptitude for learning new technologies. I want to leverage my skills into a rewarding career as a technical writer</p>
<p>By staying curious and asking the right questions, I build strong relationships with SMEs.</p>
<p>I strive to create documentation that is highly accesible and puts readers' needs first.</p>
<p>I have experience with localization project management, creating/maintaing glossaries, B2B product documentation, application copywriting, and more. I'm currently expanding my skillset by learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
